# EidosDB

**EidosDB** — *The Symbolic Memory Engine for Next‑Gen AI*

---

## 🌟 What is EidosDB?

EidosDB is a novel memory engine that combines symbolic reasoning with semantic embeddings and temporal dynamics. Instead of merely storing data, it treats each idea as a living entity that *remembers, decays, and adapts* based on use.

Think of it as a **cognitive layer**—a memory that fades, reinforces, and ranks thoughts based on context and intensity.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

* **Hybrid Symbolic Semantic Model**
  Every stored idea has:

  * a semantic embedding (vector),
  * a symbolic frequency (`w`),
 * a symbolic distance (`r`),
  * contextual metadata (e.g., emotion, origin, type),
  * and optional tags for symbolic grouping.

* **Physics-Inspired Presence Formula**

  ```ts
  v = (4 * w * r) / (π * √(1 − (w * r / c)²))
  ```

  This formula creates a “velocity-like” symbolic presence score (`v`) inspired by relativity.

* **Memory Behavior**

  * **Decay over time** (`tick()` lowers `w`)
  * **Reinforcement** (`reinforce(id)`) to boost an idea
  * **Symbolic expiration** through per-idea TTL
  * **Context-based filtering** and search

* **REST API Interface**
  Easily insert, query, decay, or reinforce memory via HTTP endpoints like `/insert`, `/query`, `/tick`, `/reinforce`.
* **Optional GraphQL endpoint**
  Expose the same operations via `/graphql` when enabled.

* **WebSocket reinforcement stream**
  Send real-time reinforcement events through `ws://localhost:3000/reinforce-stream` using JSON payloads.

* **Real-time monitoring dashboard**
  Observe symbolic metrics live at `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`.

* **API rate limiting**
  Requests are capped at 100 per minute per IP to prevent abuse.

* **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) index**
  Accelerated search for similar vectors using locality-sensitive hashing.

* **Lightweight Persistence**
  Default storage is in-memory + JSON file. Alternately supports pluggable store (e.g., Redis, SQLite).

* **Optional GPU Decay Loop**
  Weight decay can leverage GPU.js when installed, falling back to the CPU otherwise.

## 🧠 Why It Matters

EidosDB is ideal for:

* **AI agents with symbolic memory**: NPCs, chatbots, interactive systems that need long-term idea tracking.
* **Research in symbolic reasoning**: studies on decay, attention dynamics, and memory structures.
* **Personal knowledge systems**: evolving notes, thematic reminders, idea networks.
* **AGI prototypes**: symbolic-semantic hybrid cognition engines.

## 📦 Quickstart

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Execute the server:

   ```bash
   npx ts-node src/api/server.ts
   ```
4. Access API on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
5. Open the real-time dashboard at [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard)

Endpoints include:

* `POST /insert` → Insert an idea
* `GET /query?w=0.003&context=philosophy&tags=time` → Rank by symbolic presence with selectors
* `POST /tick` → Apply decay cycle
* `POST /reinforce` → Reinforce an idea
* `WS ws://localhost:3000/reinforce-stream` → Stream reinforcement events in JSON
* `GET /dump` → Dump memory snapshot
* `POST /restore` → Restore memory from a snapshot

### API keys and tiers

All HTTP requests require an `x-api-key` header. Keys are defined in `eidosdb/data/api-keys.json` and map to access tiers.

Example of key file:

```json
{
  "basic-key": "basic",
  "premium-key": "premium"
}
```

Each tier controls the number of allowed requests per minute:

| Tier    | Limit (req/min) |
|---------|-----------------|
| basic   | 5               |
| premium | 1000            |

Use the key in requests:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: basic-key" http://localhost:3000/dump
```

### GraphQL endpoint

Set the `EIDOS_GRAPHQL=true` environment variable to expose a GraphQL API at `/graphql` with a built-in GraphiQL playground.
Example:

```bash
EIDOS_GRAPHQL=true npx ts-node src/api/server.ts
```

Sample query:

```graphql
{
  ideas(w: 0.003, context: "philosophy") {
    id
    label
    v
  }
}
```

Sample mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  insertIdea(
    input: {
      id: "alpha"
      label: "time is illusion"
      vector: [0.1]
      w: 0.002
      r: 2000
      context: "philosophy"
    }
  )
}
```

### Storage adapters

Set the `EIDOS_STORAGE` variable to `memory` (default), `redis`, or `sqlite` before starting the server.
To use Redis, install the package and run an available Redis server.
For SQLite, `npm install` compiles the `better-sqlite3` module without the need for an external service.

---

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

Run EidosDB in a container without installing Node.js locally.

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The script builds the Docker image and starts the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## ⚡ Optional GPU Acceleration

The decay loop can run on the GPU using [GPU.js](https://github.com/gpujs/gpu.js). Install the library and it will be used automatically:

```bash
npm install gpu.js
```

If GPU.js or compatible hardware is unavailable, the system falls back to the CPU implementation.

---

## 🧪 Example

```ts
const idea: SemanticIdea = {
  id: "alpha",
  label: "time is illusion",
  vector: [/* semantically generated */],
  w: 0.002,
  r: 2000,
  context: "philosophy",
  metadata: { emotion: "wonder", origin: "thought experiment" },
  tags: ["time", "concept"],
};
await api.post('/insert', idea);
```

To query memory presence with selectors:

```bash
GET /query?w=0.003&context=philosophy&tags=time
```

Returns a list of ideas sorted by `v` — the higher the `v`, the more present the idea is right now and matching the provided filters.

---

## 🧪 Tests

Run the Jest unit tests to verify symbolic behavior:

```bash
cd eidosdb
npm test
```

The test suite lives in the `tests/` folder and covers core utilities and the in‑memory store.

## 🧭 Roadmap & Contributions

We have a roadmap for enhancing EidosDB including:

* Integration with real semantic models for generating `vector`s
* Symbolic clustering, context-aware snapshots
* GUI dashboard, real-time reinforcement streams, and more

We welcome contributors! See the `TODO.md` for high-level tasks and issue ideas.
