# üß¨ EidosDB

**A relativistic symbolic database for spatial-temporal access and conceptual memory.**

> ‚ÄúEidos‚Äù is the ancient Greek word for ‚Äúform‚Äù, ‚Äúessence‚Äù, or ‚Äúpure idea‚Äù.
> EidosDB is a conceptual experiment that fuses physics, philosophy, and computation to explore a new way of accessing knowledge ‚Äî not by distance or address, but by *relativistic presence*.

## üåå What is EidosDB?

EidosDB is a symbolic, experimental database that uses a relativistic-inspired formula to determine the *visibility*, *priority*, or *accessibility* of stored data points in a non-linear, space-time-like structure.

Instead of classical indexing, we use:

$$
v = \frac{4wr}{\pi \sqrt{1 - (wr/c)^2}}
$$

Where:

* `w` = symbolic angular frequency (how often a concept is accessed or pulsed)
* `r` = symbolic distance or relevance from the core query
* `c` = the speed of light (symbolizing the maximum information speed)
* `v` = effective access speed (used to sort or retrieve data)

The closer a data-point is to `wr ‚âà c`, the more "present" it becomes ‚Äî yet the system prevents it from ever reaching `c`, creating a natural limitation on overfitting or data collapse.

## üß† Use Cases

* **Symbolic memory system** for AI agents (e.g. memory prioritization by frequency √ó distance)
* **Temporal-spatial access models** for storytelling engines or NPC dialogue trees
* **Conceptual indexing** in philosophical or artistic applications
* **Experimental data ranking systems** based on relativistic-like constraints

## üì¶ Installation

> Requires Node.js / TypeScript for initial prototype.
> Future versions may support Python or Rust backends.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eidosdb.git
cd eidosdb
npm install
```

---

## üîç Example Query (WIP)

```ts
const result = queryEidosDB({
  angularFrequency: 0.04,   // symbolic "w"
  distance: 3500,           // symbolic "r"
  c: 299792458              // constant c
});

// Returns: effective access velocity "v"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Roadmap

* [x] Define core relativistic access function
* [ ] Implement data structure for storage with symbolic attributes
* [ ] Rank entries by effective velocity `v`
* [ ] Add temporal decay / memory aging system
* [ ] Add visualization of the database as a "memory field"
* [ ] Optional: Web API for AI systems to connect to EidosDB
* [ ] Implement persistence layer (JSON file, SQLite or MongoDB)
* [ ] Add CLI tool for inserting and querying data
* [ ] Create test suite (unit + integration)
* [ ] Add support for relational and graph-based symbolic links
* [ ] Introduce time-dilation simulation for memory fragmentation
* [ ] Build live dashboard to monitor memory evolution in time
* [ ] Publish concept paper or documentation explaining symbolic logic
* [ ] Optional plugin: connect EidosDB to language model memory interfaces (e.g., SAGE)

## üìñ Philosophy

EidosDB is not just a database ‚Äî it's a **model of symbolic cognition**. It simulates how entities might access memory or knowledge based not on absolute addresses, but on a warped structure of *frequency, proximity, and existential relevance*. Like a mind drifting toward a truth it can't fully reach.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This is an **experimental** and **non-standard** approach to data storage and retrieval.
It is not optimized for production systems, but rather as a sandbox for symbolic, cognitive or artistic exploration.
